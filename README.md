# Next.js Project Documentation

This project is built using **Next.js**, a React framework for building fast, scalable web applications. This guide provides you with the steps to set up and start your Next.js project, along with some basic explanations and resources for learning more.

## Prerequisites

Before you start, ensure that you have the following installed on your system:

- **Node.js**: Next.js requires Node.js to run. You can download it from [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org/).
- **Package Manager**: You can use npm (default with Node.js), yarn, pnpm, or bun as a package manager.

### Installing Next.js with `create-next-app`

To get started with Next.js, you need to create a new project. The easiest way to do this is by using `create-next-app`, which sets up a new Next.js application for you with all the necessary configurations.

Run the following commands to create a new Next.js app:

```bash
# Using npx (npm 5.2+)
npx create-next-app@latest your-project-name
# or using yarn
yarn create next-app your-project-name
# or using pnpm
pnpm create next-app your-project-name
# or using bun
bun create next-app your-project-name
